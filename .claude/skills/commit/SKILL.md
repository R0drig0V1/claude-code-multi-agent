# Commit

Create one focused commit for the current changes of this workspace.

## 1. Inspect

```bash
git status --short
git diff            # unstaged
git diff --staged   # staged
git log --oneline -10   # match the existing style
```

- If the changes mix unrelated concerns (e.g. a bug fix and a new feature), propose splitting
  them into several commits and stage per concern (`git add <paths>`).
- **Never stage**: `.env` or any secret/credential, `.venv/`, `node_modules/`, build output,
  data dumps, large binaries. If one of those is staged, unstage it and tell the user.

## 2. Verify before committing

Run from the workspace root and fix or report failures. Do not commit red checks unless the
user explicitly says so.

```bash
scripts/check.sh
```

`scripts/check.sh` holds the project's lint, type and test commands. If it still prints the
"no checks configured" warning, tell the user once.

If the change needs a companion artefact (a migration for a schema change, a regenerated
lockfile, an updated `docs/` page), make sure it is in the same commit.

## 3. Message

Conventional Commits, **in English, no emojis**, imperative mood, subject ≤ 72 chars:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body: what changed and WHY, wrapped at 72 columns; bullets are fine>
```

- `type`: feat, fix, refactor, perf, test, docs, build, ci, chore.
- `scope`: the package or area touched (look at `git log` for the scopes in use), e.g. `api`,
  `docs`, `claude`, `infra`.
- Mention migrations or breaking changes explicitly in the body.
- End the message with the co-author / attribution trailer this environment specifies, if any.

Use a heredoc so formatting survives:

```bash
git commit -F - <<'MSG'
feat(api): add user login endpoint

- Validate credentials against the users table
- Add tests for wrong password and locked account
MSG
```

## 4. Report

Show `git log --oneline -1` and summarise what was committed and anything left unstaged.
Do not push; pushing is part of the `pr` skill.
