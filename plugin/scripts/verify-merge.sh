# Verify the working tree of the main worktree (normally a PR merged with --no-commit) before
# the integrator commits the merge. Exit code 0 means every check passed; anything else means
# do not merge. Gate the commit on the exit code, never on grepped output:
#
#   if "$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT"/scripts/verify-merge.sh; then git commit ...; else git merge --abort; fi
#
# Usage:
#   verify-merge.sh               full verification
#   verify-merge.sh --reset-only  only reset shared verification state (after
#                                 `git merge --abort`)
#
# Steps, stopping at the first failure:
# 1. scripts/verify-reset.sh, if the project has one: recreate shared state (e.g. the
#    integrator's test database) from scratch, so state left by an earlier, aborted
#    verification cannot break (or fake) this one.
# 2. scripts/worktree-setup.sh, if present: install dependencies the PR may have added.
# 3. scripts/check.sh: lint, formatting, types and tests. A project without one only gets a
#    warning, so configure it before trusting a VERIFY OK.
#
# Part of the multi-agent plugin; the scripts above belong to the project and are resolved
# from the repository of the current directory.
#
# Only for the integrator.
