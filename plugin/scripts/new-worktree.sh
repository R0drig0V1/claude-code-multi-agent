# Create a development worktree for one branch, ready to code and test in isolation.
#
# Usage: new-worktree.sh <type>/<short-kebab-name>   e.g. feat/user-login
#
# Part of the multi-agent plugin; run it from anywhere inside the project's repository (the
# /multi-agent:worktree skill does). It works on the repository of the current directory.
#
# - Creates ../<repo>-<short-kebab-name> on a new branch <type>/<short-kebab-name>, from
#   origin/main when it exists (the integrator pushes main there), else local main.
# - Copies the main checkout's .env, if there is one (it is not tracked by git).
# - Runs scripts/worktree-setup.sh inside the new worktree when the project has one: the
#   place for per-worktree setup such as `uv sync`, `pnpm install` or creating a private test
#   database (worktrees must never share one: tests usually wipe it). It receives the branch
#   name as $1. A failing setup only warns, so the worktree is still usable.
