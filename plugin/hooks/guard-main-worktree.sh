# worktrees have their own git dir under .git/worktrees/). Files outside any git repository,
# and repositories that did not enable the plugin in their .claude/settings(.local).json, are
# allowed. Exit code 2 blocks the tool call and shows stderr to the agent.

Blocked: $file is in the main worktree, which only the integrator session may modify.
Work in your own worktree instead: /multi-agent:worktree <type>/<name>
(see "Multi-agent workflow" in CLAUDE.md). If you are the integrator, launch Claude Code
with scripts/integrator.sh (CLAUDE_ROLE=integrator).
